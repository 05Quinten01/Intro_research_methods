# Guide on how to use the script

With this shell script, I counted how many times the article 'de' appeared in the Wikipedia page of the Rijksuniversiteit of Groningen.

The steps that you need to execute to use the script:
1. Download the script by clicking the green button in the repository with 'code' in it.
2. Open the Linux shell in the same directory as the script you just downloaded is located (shift + left-click)
3. Clone the repository using the following: clone https://github.com/05Quinten01/Intro_research_methods
4. To execute the program, type in the shell the following: ./sample.sh or sh sample.sh or bash sample.sh

This script can also be done on different Wikipedia pages and/or with a different word. Just chance the link with the link of the page you want to run it on. 
For the word, chance 'de' with the word you want to use ('your_word').
