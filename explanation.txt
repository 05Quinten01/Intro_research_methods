This shell script takes the Wikipedia page of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen and counts how many times the article 'de' appears on the page.


Here I will explain what everything in the script does, for every part of the code (seperated with pipes ('|')):

wget https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen -q -O - :
wget = used to retrieve files from web servers (followed by the link of the web you want to use)
-q = turns off wget's output
-O = writes to a file 
- = 'file' where it is been written to

grep -o -i -w 'de' :
grep = print lines matching a pattern
-o = output the matched parts of a matching line
-i = ignore uppercase vs. lowercase (for the word you are using)
-w = checking for full words, not for sub-strings
'de' = the word you want to count

wc -l :
wc = print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
-l = counts the lines


The output should be equal to this, if you use the same script with the same word and on the same page: 311
